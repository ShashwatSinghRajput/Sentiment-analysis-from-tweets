# Objective: 

In this coursework, you will implement a Support Vector Machine classifier (or SVM) that classifies tweets according to their sentiment, i.e. positive or negative. You will derive features from the text of the tweets to build and train the classifier on part of the dataset. You will then test the accuracy of your classifier on an unseen portion of the dataset.
