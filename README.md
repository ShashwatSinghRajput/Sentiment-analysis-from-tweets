# Sentiment Analysis Project: Enhancing Performance through Advanced Text Processing and Feature Engineering

# Project Overview
This project is focused on developing a sentiment analysis model, emphasizing the importance of effective text processing and feature engineering. The goal was to improve performance over a baseline model by refining preprocessing steps, feature extraction techniques, and model tuning.

# Process and Improvements

## Data Preprocessing

The initial step involved parsing sentiment dataset entries to extract relevant text and labels. This process required slicing specific columns from each data row. The critical enhancement in this phase was the introduction of advanced preprocessing techniques, including:

- Removal of URLs and emojis to reduce bias and improve performance.
- Separation of punctuation from words for clearer sentence boundaries and precise tokenization.
- Elimination of '@' and '#' symbols to focus on semantic content.
- Standardization through tokenization and converting all tokens to lowercase.
- Implementation of WordNet lemmatization to normalize words and reduce their inflected forms to a common base.

These preprocessing steps were iteratively refined, with a particular focus on the impact of each step on the overall model performance.

## Feature Extraction

The transformation of text data into a suitable format for machine learning models involved using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorizer. This approach outperformed alternatives such as CountVectorizer, Word2Vec, GloVe, and various n-gram configurations due to its effectiveness in:

- Assigning higher weights to informative and discriminative terms.
- Down-weighting common stop words, enhancing the classifier's focus on relevant features.

A global feature dictionary was maintained to track all tokens and feature names appearing across the dataset, aiding in the incremental building of a robust feature set.

## Model Training and Cross-Validation

A linear support vector classifier (SVC) was employed, with the cost parameter finely tuned to 0.5. This choice struck a balance between model complexity and generalization capability, reducing the risk of overfitting. The model was subjected to 10-fold cross-validation on the training data, ensuring robust evaluation across various subsets.

## Error Analysis and Observations

Error analysis was conducted using a subset of the data, focusing on identifying false positives and false negatives. This analysis led to the following observations and subsequent adjustments:

- Hyperlinks and emojis were found to introduce bias and were removed.
- Certain contractions and symbols were creating a bias towards false negatives, necessitating their careful handling.
- The removal of '@', '#', and careful handling of stopwords significantly improved model performance.

## Results and Conclusion

The optimized model demonstrated substantial improvements across all metrics compared to the baseline. Key findings include:

- The importance of feature selection and engineering in sentiment analysis.
- The effectiveness of TF-IDF in emphasizing meaningful words while reducing the impact of repetitive or less informative terms.
- A larger dataset could potentially further enhance performance, as indicated by cross-validation results.

The project's outcomes highlight the significance of nuanced text processing and feature engineering in natural language processing, particularly in sentiment analysis. While performance improved markedly, the analysis also identified areas for further enhancement, especially in understanding complex emotions and nuances like sarcasm.
